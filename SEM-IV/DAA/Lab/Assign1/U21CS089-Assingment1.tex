\subsection{Conclusion}
The graph for the worst case is a straight line with some slope. A straight line implies that
the change in time taken is linearly dependent on the change in the no. of elements in the file,
as the line is given by $y = mx + c$.
Therefore, it can be concluded that the time complexity for linear search is $O(n)$.
Theoretically also time complexity comes out to be $O(n)$. Thus the conclusion matches to the theoretical
value of the time complexity.

\section{Bubble Sort}
\subsection{Algorithm -}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Create a file pointer and Open the File
 \item Insert the values into an array.
 \item Start two loops. Outer loop as number of elements in the array, inner as no. of elements - iterator
 \item Swap the elements if the current is bigger than the next.

\subsection{Conclusion}
The graph for the worst case is a quadratic. A quadratic curve implies that
the change in time taken is quadratically dependent on the change in the no. of elements in the file,
as the line is given by $y = 4ax^2$.
Therefore, it can be concluded that the time complexity for Bubble Sort is $O(n^2)$.
Theoretically also time complexity comes out to be $O(n^2)$. Thus the conclusion matches to the theoretical
value of the time complexity.
