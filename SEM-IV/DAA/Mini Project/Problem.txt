The problem is to determine whether or not it is possible to tile the courtyard with these 
tiles in such a way that no two tiles overlap or leave any part of the courtyard uncovered. 
The problem statement typically specifies the dimensions of the courtyard and the dimensions 
of the L-shaped tiles. The problem is often stated as a decision problem: given a rectangular 
courtyard and L-shaped tiles of a specified size, can the courtyard be tiled with the tiles in 
a non-overlapping manner?
